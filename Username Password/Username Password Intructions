Program 1: (Password Protection)
This program is meant to give you practice using dictionaries.

Write a program that first reads from a user a set of usernames and passwords, and then enters a program that simulates a user typing in passwords.

In the first part of the program, you are to read in a single integer that states the number of username/password pairs that you will read in.  Following this, there will be a set of that many user names, one per line.  Then there will be a set of that many passwords, one per line.  You only need to prompt one time at the beginning of the program.  

For example, input might be:
3
John
Jim
Joe
SecreT_passWorD
12345
G$a-4(ztY

Once that is read in, you should then repeatedly ask the person to type in a username and then password.  If they have a valid username and password combination, then print a message that they are allowed into the system.  If they have an incorrect username/password, then tell them (and allow them) to try again (repeatedly).

Note: in practice, although this is the basic way passwords are handled, they should not be stored in an unencrypted format even in the program.  Instead, passwords are encrypted when they are typed in, they are stored in an encrypted format, and the comparisons are always between encrypted passwords.  There are also more extreme security measures.
